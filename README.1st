ATTENTION!

This is not the original ORLite.pm. This fork serves a a repository for
testing some optimizations.

Divergence from the real ORLite.pm

  - Objects are array references
  - Most select statemtns are executed without slicing into hashes
  - Simple accessors are lvalue accessors.

For the real ORLite.pm see http://search.cpan.org/dist/ORLite/
