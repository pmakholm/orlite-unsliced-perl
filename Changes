Changes for Perl extension ORLite

1.25 Sat 15 Aug 2009
	- Adding base and table metadata methods to each class to support
	  the creation of support/extension methods

1.24 Sat 15 Aug 2009
	- Adding support for an iterate method

1.23 Thu 11 Jun 2009 
	- Fixed a bug in method ->delete which deleted more than the actual
	  object in case the primary key consist of more than one column.
	  Added basic support for such primary keys with more than one column.

1.22 Mon  1 Jun 2009
	- Updated to Module::Install::DSL 0.91
	- Split out debug/eval as (undocument) dval function
	- App support for a (currently undocumented) 'append'
	  param to allow sub-classes like ORLite::Mirror to merge
	  in additional code to the generated class.

1.21 Sun 24 May 2009
	- Updated to Module::Install::DSL 0.88
	- Added commit_begin and rollback_begin to allow persisting
	  of the connection between successive transactions.

1.20 Thu 12 Feb 2009
	- Auto-create parent directory for ORLite files
	- Add root method ->sqlite which returns the path to the
	  sqlite file for that database.

1.19 Tue  3 Feb 2009
	- Adding support for using a CODE reference in the 'create'
	  parameter, so that the schema setup can be provided directly
	  in the ORLite initialisation.

1.18 Wed 14 Jan 2009
	- Adding an ->orlite method to return the version number of the
	  ORLite module that was used to generate the distribution.

1.17 Sat  3 Jan 2009
	- Adding a ->truncate method to each table

1.16 Sat 14 Dec 2008
	- The fact that I didn't need to change ORLite for ORLite::Migrate
	  suggests that it's stable enough for general use (pending 2.0)

0.15 Wed 24 Sep 2008
	- Adding support for writable pragmas
	- Adding tests for pragmas, schema_version and user_version

0.14 Tue 23 Sep 2008
	- Removed the last remnants of %ORLite::DSN and %ORLite::DBH.
	- Added support for the "create" param to allow database creation

0.13 Fri 19 Sep 2008
	- Fixed critical bug introduced in 0.10 or somewhere around there,
	  where column accessors were not defined for readonly classes.
	  (This fatally killed ORLite::Mirror)

0.12 Mon 15 Sep 2008
	- Don't store the database values in a shared hash any more
	  (Makes the classes self-contained and able to run without ORLite)
        - Add a tables param to the import, to allow the base database
          connectivity class to be created without the table classes.

0.11 Tue  9 Sep 2008
	- If we aren't debugging we don't need to write the temp file

0.10 Wed  6 Aug 2008
        - Quote all column names for explicitness

0.09 Fri 11 Jul 2008
	- Adding pragma method to the top package
	- Adding user_version import param to provide the ability
	  to lock the Perl code against a known-good schema.

0.08 Tue 24 Jun 2008
	- Adding an experimental -DEBUG option

0.07 Wed 28 May 2008
	- Actually trust the package param

0.06 Wed 28 May 2008
	- Don't add transaction support if we are readonly

0.05 Tue 27 May 2008
	- Minor bug fixes in the ->import method
	- Correcting the RT link in the POD.

0.04 Tue 27 May 2008
	- Added ->import( \%hash ) support.
	- Added support for custom passing of the target package.
	- Added support for readonly database loading
	  (We need this for doing mirrored remote db support)
	- Autodetect readonly SQLite files

0.03 Thu 22 May 2008
	- Added initial foreign key support
	- Added the POD documentation for ORLite root packages
	- Added File::Spec dependency

0.02 Mon 19 May 2008
